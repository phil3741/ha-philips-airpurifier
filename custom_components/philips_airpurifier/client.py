    Upstream aiocoap's DTLSClientConnection._start() in tinydtls.py contains a
    'return' in a 'finally' block, which triggers a compile-time SyntaxWarning on
    Python 3.14+. philips-airctrl uses only coap:// (plain UDP CoAP), not DTLS
    (coaps://), but aiocoap pre-imports available client transports when
    initializing the client context. Later, DTLSClientConnection._start() imports
    DTLSSocket.

    Preloading tinydtls here under a scoped filter suppresses the warning without
    affecting transport availability or making DTLS usable. This workaround can
    be removed once upstream aiocoap releases a fix for DTLSClientConnection._start().
